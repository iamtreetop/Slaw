# Slaw

Slaw is a Health and Fitness Social Media application that allows a user to explore many differents communities and allow them to interact with others. Users can form communities with those who have common fitness goals.


## Background and Overview

We have noticed firsthand that many individuals prefer to workout in groups or with others, and that there lacked a clearcut go-to place to coordinate with and find workout partners. We wanted to take the aspects of effective and easy-to-use collaborative-workplace apps into the health and fitness community.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to easily find someone to workout with at a moment's notice? To be able to coordinate workouts and other events with your workout buddies? And to be able to be part of an online community surrounded by those with similar fitness goals and interests.

Slaw, which stands for Searchable Logs of All Workouts, will be accompanied by a web application which lets users join and create channels, todos, events, and communicate via a live chat with members of their channels!

We will need to:
* Make a web/mobile application that allows users to create and join channels to communicate with others in the community
* Build a database to store users, channels, events, and todo items.
* Allow users to create events/todo workouts and communicate with their channel or join public channel
* Implement Google Maps API and EventsBrite API to display events happening close to their geolocation and join the public even channels

## Functionality & MVP

* User authorization: sign up and log in
* MVP 2 - Channels
* MVP 3 - Events/Todos
* MVP 4 - Comments
* MVP 5 - Google Maps/EventBrite API

## Technologies & Technical Challenges

We think some of the technical challenges will come with how we set the backend for our channels, events, todos, and our live chat feature. The live chat feature will accompany events happening within a channel and have users be able to communicate with one another there.

Researching more on Google Maps/EventBrite API might pose issues when we want to be able to create public channels for events happening near the area.

Researching and developing how to implement a live chat feature.

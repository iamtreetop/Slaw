Rabbithole is a Chrome Extension that lets you analyze your browsing habits.

## Background and Overview

Sometimes, when you’re doing research, you don’t just want to save a page; you want to save a whole group of tabs. If you get somewhere interesting, you may ask yourself, “How did I get here?” Rabbithole will tell you how, and let you save those paths.git

Rabbithole will be accompanied by a Web application which lets a user visualize and interact with these saved paths. Potentially add a favorites feature -- favorite an entire tree/subtree: a RABBITHOLE!

We will need to:
* Make a Chrome extension that collects data
* Build a database to store user and browsing data
* Construct a Web application for visualization of and interaction with the collected browser data
* Decide how to handle privacy issues: ideally, store data on user machines and give them options to delete unwanted data

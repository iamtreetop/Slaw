# Slaw

Slaw is a Health and Fitness Social Media application that allows a user to explore many differents communities and allow them to interact with others. Users can form communities with those who have common fitness goals.


## Background and Overview

We have noticed with personal experience that many individuals prefer to workout in groups or with others.

Wanted to take the aspect of collobarative and community into with health and fitness community.


Sometimes, when you’re doing research, you don’t just want to save a page; you want to save a whole group of tabs. If you get somewhere interesting, you may ask yourself, “How did I get here?” Rabbithole will tell you how, and let you save those paths.git

Rabbithole will be accompanied by a Web application which lets a user visualize and interact with these saved paths. Potentially add a favorites feature -- favorite an entire tree/subtree: a RABBITHOLE!

We will need to:
* Make a web/mobile application that allows users to create and join channels to communicate with others in the community
* Build a database to store users, channels, events, and todo items.
* Allow users to create events/todo workouts and communicate with their channel or join public channel
* Implement Google Maps API and EventsBrite API to display events happening close to their geolocation and join the public even channels

## Functionality & MVP

* User authorization: sign up and log in
* MVP 2 - Channels
* MVP 3 - Events/Todos
* MVP 4 - Comments
* MVP 5 - Google Maps/EventBrite API

## Technologies & Technical Challenges

We think some of the technical challenges will come with how we set the backend for our channels, events, and todos. We also want to implements comments for any events happening within a channel and have users be able to communicate with one another there.

Researching more on Google Maps/EventBrite API might pose issues when we want to be able to create public channels for events happening near the area.
